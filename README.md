# Smart Meeting Scheduler – Kaggle Capstone Project (Concierge Track)

This project is a simple AI agent that automatically schedules meetings using:
1. **Tool Use** – mock calendar read/write  
2. **Multi-step Planning** – parse request → find free slots → rank → schedule  
3. **Memory** – stores user preferences + last scheduled meeting  

### How to run  
Open the Google Colab notebook and paste the 3 cells (A, B, C).  
Run them top to bottom to see the BEFORE and AFTER scheduling demo.
